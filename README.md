# MoCA

This repository contains the design files for MoCA (**Insert description**).

The [Mechanical Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design) directory contains all the design files. The DXF files include the designs of the MDF and acrylic parts that should be laser-cut, and the PNG file shows a diagram with assembly instructions. In the [Corner_design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design/Corner_design), the DXF files contain the designs of the MDF parts that compose the corners of the modules, which should also be laser-cut, as well as a PDF with assembly instructions. The [MoCA_Block_STL](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design/MoCA_Block_STL) contains the 3D models of the already assembled base and top parts of the module, for visualisation purposes.
