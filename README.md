# MoCA

This repository contains the design files for MoCA: an open-source modular system to perform experiments with robot swarms.

MoCA provides tools to create, simulate, and physically deploy scenarios where robots react to the color displayed by programmable RGB modules. Users of MoCA can create these scenarios—also known as robot arenas—by assembling the RGB modules in polygonal structures that enclose the workspace of the robots

The [Mechanical Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design) directory contains all the design files. The DXF files include the designs of the MDF and acrylic parts that should be laser-cut, and the PNG file shows a diagram with assembly instructions. In the [Corner_design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design/Corner_design), the DXF files contain the designs of the MDF parts that compose the corners of the modules, which should also be laser-cut, as well as a PDF with assembly instructions. The [MoCA_Block_STL](https://github.com/demiurge-project/moca-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design/MoCA_Block_STL) contains the 3D models of the already assembled base and top parts of the module, for visualisation purposes.
